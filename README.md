## Challenges
Working in groups has challenges. Trying work around everyone's schedule is hard. GIT GIT GIT GIT was the biggest challenges of them all. We ran into so many conflicts and problems with the teams seeing changes that other team members were making. Working with the google map api comes in a strong second place with challenges. Reading the documentation and implementing it was no easy task.
